Description:
    I FREAKING DID IT! I didn't think I would
    ever learn how 3d projection worked because
    no one on here would explain it better or
    point to thorough sources. Anyways, shoutout
    to Dylan Missuwe for inspiring me to learn.
    Everything I needed was contained on this page:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection#cite_note-3
    Matrices can be used, but I have doubts about
    its performance value...anyways, I hope this
    will be helpful to all wanting to learn
    about 3d graphics.

Version: 1.1

Update: 1.1 - Added Drawing Order (Z-Buffer)
              but it doesn't work quite right yet.
